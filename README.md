# DiscordantCirce
A Discord platform TF bot made using the lovely DSharpPlus Library
This project is current in a VERY rough alpha stage.
Where-ever your place this project/executable, you need an oauth.txt file in the same directory as the executable, and a 
forms folder in the same directory as the executable. 
The forms are all XML files.

Please do not name the files with numbers anymore. This makes it much more difficult to troubleshoot files that are causing erroneous TFs. Any pull requests made after 06/30/17 will be denied if a form XML file has a number-name.

Instead, please use your suffix to name your file. 

A dingo chef form with dingochef as the suffix should be named dingochef.xml, for example.

PLEASE feel free to file issues and request features.
I would love to make an awesome TF themed bot for anyone to use!
A TODO is pending, and will appear here soon!


This project is open source: I'm still deciding on a license right now, but for now, I want to simply say is please credit me where you can, and point people to the DSharpPlus library if you think you can do better. <3 Let's make this project/idea kickass!
