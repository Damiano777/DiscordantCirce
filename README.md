# DiscordantCirce
A Discord platform TF bot made using the lovely DSharpPlus Library
This project is current in a VERY rough alpha stage.
Where-ever your place this project/executable, you need an oauth.txt file in the same directory as the executable, and a 
forms folder in the same directory as the executable. 
The forms are all XML files, of the following format. Each attribute has a short description:
<Form>
  <description>This is as short sentence describing a tf. The @user symbol will be replaced with a user's nickname.</description>
  <suffix>A suffix to be attached to a user ID. If user Tyr is turned into a vixen, a -vixen suffix should be appplied, turning Tyr into Tyr-vixen!</suffix>
</Form>

PLEASE feel free to file issues and request features.
I would love to make an awesome TF themed bot for anyone to use!
A TODO is pending, and will appear here soon!
