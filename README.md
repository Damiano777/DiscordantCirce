# DiscordantCirce
A Discord platform TF bot made using the lovely DSharpPlus Library
This project is current in a VERY rough alpha stage.
Where-ever your place this project/executable, you need an oauth.txt file in the same directory as the executable, and a 
forms folder in the same directory as the executable. 
The forms are all XML files.
//</Form>

PLEASE feel free to file issues and request features.
I would love to make an awesome TF themed bot for anyone to use!
A TODO is pending, and will appear here soon!


This project is open source: I'm still deciding on a license right now, but for now, I want to simply say is please credit me where you can, and point people to the DSharpPlus library if you think you can do better. <3 Let's make this project/idea kickass!
